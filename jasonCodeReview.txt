File - index.html

- The meta tag is in the wrong place. 
- Head tag is missing.
- Script tags are in the wrong place.
- Coding style needs to be improved.  The html inside of the body tag should be nested for calrity as well. The
<div ng-app="masterDetail"> inside your body should be nested. 

Google for proper html structure to find out how to fix these issues.
